## Dataset
The dataset includes details about various car models from multiple manufacturers, with columns for:
- **Manufacturer**: Car brand (e.g., Acura, BMW).
- **Model**: Car model name.
- **Sales_in_thousands**: Number of units sold (in thousands).
- **Price_in_thousands**: Price of the car (in thousands).
- **Horsepower**: Engine power in horsepower.
- **Fuel_efficiency**: Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon).
- **Vehicle_type**: Car type (Passenger, Car).
- **__year_resale_value**: Estimated resale value after one year.

## Key Insights
- **Top Manufacturers by Sales**: Ford, Dodge and Toyota lead the market in total sales.
- **Horsepower vs. Price Correlation**: A strong positive correlation (**0.85**) between horsepower and price, indicating that more powerful cars tend to be more expensive.
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Most cars have a fuel efficiency between 20-30 MPG, with a few exceeding 40 MPG.
- **Best Power-to-Performance Ratio**: Toyota Tacoma offers the best horsepower-to-price ratio.
